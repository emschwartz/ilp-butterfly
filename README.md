# Butterfly ILP
> Minimal ILP/SPSP client in the browser

Butterfly is a fully client-side app for sending Interledger payments from the browser.

It uses the [ILP Client](https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp) and the [ILP Plugin RPC](https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin-payment-channel-framework) to send Interledger payments from the browser. The UI is built with [Cell.js](http://www.celljs.org) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).
